Compiler notes

compiler is like a translater 
it convert the code into assembly

code -> (compiler)-> Assembly ->(assembler) -> object file ->(linker) combine libraries with the object code-> executable

## NASM for assembler and GNU linker for linker 


## to build the compiler

baby <input.by>
kushagrapandey:~/Home/Desktop/Code/Cook$ ./build/cook temp.by //it genrates the assembly code, object file and executable only
kushagrapandey:~/Home/Desktop/Code/Cook$ ./out // it runs the executable file
kushagrapandey:~/Home/Desktop/Code/Cook$ echo $? // it shows the exit code of the executable file



Tokenaizer->parsing->code creation



Tokenaizer 
it parse the input into the tokens


parsing   (parse tree)
it analyse the token sequence to determine its grammatical structure with respect to a given formal grammar 


code creation



## arena allocator
it is a memory allocation technique that allocates a large block of memory at once and then doles out smaller chunks of that block as needed. 
This approach can be more efficient than traditional memory allocation methods, especially in scenarios where many small allocations and deallocations are required.
